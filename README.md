# Community DVD Library Management System üé¨

This project is a **C# .NET 8 console application**.  
It simulates a community library system that manages a collection of movie DVDs, allowing both **staff** and **members** to interact with the system through role-based menus.

## üìå Features

### Staff Functions
- Add movie DVDs to the system.  
- Remove DVDs (or remove a movie entirely if no copies remain).  
- Register new members with a four-digit password.  
- Remove registered members (only if they have returned all DVDs).  
- Search for a member‚Äôs phone number by full name.  
- Find all members currently renting a particular movie.  

### Member Functions
- View all movies in dictionary order by title.  
- Display details of a particular movie by title.  
- Borrow up to **five (5)** movies at a time (no duplicate copies).  
- Return DVDs to the library.  
- View current DVDs borrowed by the member.  
- Display the **top three most frequently borrowed movies** in descending order of borrow count.
